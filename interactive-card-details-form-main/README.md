# Frontend Mentor - Interactive card details form (Front End Mentor)

**Project done for learning purposes**

## Partial Solution (development ongoing)

### What is done:
- Form with interactivity and validation. I took the approach to display the error messages when user change focus.
- There is big potential to improve the code.

### What is missing:
- Confirmation button action plus confirmation page itself 

### Challenges ahead:
- Study the functioning of the button + display of confirmation page
- Study how to clear and reset
